# Preparations

## At the beginning of the day

- Make sure the EMG Acquisition Unit is plugged in electricity and into the computer
- _(Optional)_ Make sure the rest of the electrical equipment is connected correctly as stated in the `Equipment Overview` chapter
  This setup should never be interrupted, so there is no need to do it every day. However, it is good to take a look at the beginning of an experiment run.
- Turn on the EMG Acquisition Unit's Power button
  Small green light turns on
- Plug BIOPAC USB license key in the acquisition computer on the left
  **Note:** Don’t lose the little plastic cap!
- Plug the Smart Amplifiers into the Amplifier Input Module.
  - Place the Smart amplifiers in the first and second port on the front side of the EMG
  - Cables are in the top drawer of the shelf
- Connect the Electrode leads into each of the Smart Amplifiers
  - Each on has a white, red and a black cable
  - Electrode cable in first port goes to the corrugator, electrode cable in second port goes to the zygomaticus
- A white, flat cable with a blue plug runs from the experiment computer (on the right) to the EMG (should already be plugged in, if not do so now)
  - This is the 25-pin parallel port

## Shortly before the participant arrives

### Open AcqKnowledge program

- Sometimes you’ll need to try it several times with "Retry Connection"
- Window pops up
- Click on "new experiment"
  - First radio button, usually already selected
- Choose template → FeedbackXX template.acq (so that the recording is well formatted)
- Save as "Dokumente" → "Feedback" → "EMG data" as FeedbackXX.acq (until now it was called Untitled1)
  - XX = participant-ID e.g. 02
- To change the y-axis in the recording, click on the column on
  the right and change "scale" e.g. to 0.5

### Prepare experiment

- On the experiment computer, open up the experiment script
- A dialogue window opens up asking for information
- Type in the participant's subject number
- It asks for the participant's age and gender
  - Leave the window as is at this stage
  - You will ask them this information when they are seated

### Prepare for the participant

- Put Electrode gel into the syringe
- Place one side of the Electrode tape on the electrode
  - Align the hole of the tape with the hole in the electrode
  - Don't take the sticker of the tape's other side
- Apply the Electrode gel into the holes of the electrodes
  - Use tissues to wipe off any excess gel
    - Gel should perfectly align with the rim
- Place the prepared electrodes on a piece of tissue

## The participant has arrived

1. Ask the participant to take a seat

2. Get an informed consent from the participant

3. Ask the participant for the required information (age and gender) and type it into the experiment's dialogue window

   - What should result is the Welcome Screen of the experiment: **Leave it as is!**

4. Explain to the participant that you are going to place electrodes to their face in order to record facial muscle activation

5. Ask them to take a seat slightly on the side in order to allow you a better angle for the procedure

   1. Put skin preparation gel on a cotton pad
      - Apply and rub the gel on the relevant area with cotton pad
      - The dead skin-cells will become visible
      - Make that you:
        - ...apply the gel at the complete area
        - ...rub away all the dead skin-cells away from the area
   2. Open a alcohol wipe pack
      - Use the alcohol wipe to disinfect the complete area
   3. Place electrodes on the face (remove stickers beforehand)
      - Correct electrode placement is explained elsewhere...
   4. Ask the participant to turn their chair back towards the experiment computer
      - Ask them to make themselves comfortable as they will not be able to move much around after this
   5. When the participant is ready, clip electrode cables on the electrodes (colours do matter)
      - Black is for the ground electrode
      - White and Red are for the muscle electrodes
   6. Secure cables with the attached clips to the clothes and with pins to the hair
      - Make sure that the cables don’t dangle in the participant’s face or hang down loosely behind the head

6. In the acquisition computer, start the recording in AcqKnowledge by pressing "Start" (green arrow)

7. Check baseline before starting the experiment

   - "Please frown a few times, and now please smile, and again"
   - Check that everything’s being recorded correctly, that everything stays in place and that the baseline doesn’t include too much noise
   - If there is an unusual amount of noise in the recordings, you will need to reapply the electrodes
     - With new gel, electrode tape, etc.

8. Final instructions for the participant

   - "If the electrodes feel loose, please tell me"
   - The experiment should be done sitting as still as possible
   - The participant should hardly move their head and body during the whole experiment

     - The electrodes will record that too

9. The participant can now start the experiment

### Notes:

- If an electrode falls off during the experiment, please tell the participant to continue the experiment until the current trial block is finished
  - After the trial block is finished, there will be a break where you will be able to reapply the electrodes
  - After reapplication, check the baseline again and then allow the participant to continue the experiment
- Let the EMG recording run the whole time after you've started, even if e.g. an electrode fell off or if you needed to start a new session

## After the experiment has ended

1. Stop the recording and save it (make sure that you really saved it, check the file size, should be a number around 120 000 KB)

2. Detach the electrode leads from the electrodes and the support clips from the participant's clothing

3. Ask the participant to turn towards you again

4. Peel off the electrodes and place them on a tissue for further cleaning

5. Remove the excess gel of the participant's face with a cotton pad and disinfect the area with a new alcohol pad again. Finish by cleaning excess alcohol moisture with a cotton pad

6. Thank the participant and finish all administrative business with them (credit, money, etc.; debriefing)

## Between participants

1. Make sure the data on the experiment computer is saved

2. Peel the electrode tape of the electrodes

3. Clean the used gel in the electrode with a cotton swab stick

4. Throw away all the trash that has accumulated

5. If you have a new participant, redo the steps outlined in the `Prepare experiment` chapter
   - Start a new experiment
   - Reapply the electrode tape and gel

## At the end of the day

- Clean syringe with water
  - Fill completely and press out several times; don’t use soap!
  - Dry carefully
- Clean electrodes with cotton swabs (see above) AND clean them under running water, then dry thoroughly.
  - Place the dry and clean electrodes back in their plastic bags
- Close the AcqKnowledge program and remove the BIOPAC license key
  - Place the license key in the top drawer of the shelf
- Turn off EMG (Power-button on the back side)
- Save the new EMG data collected that day on the back-up flash drive
  - EMG data from the acquisition computer under:
    - "Feedback" → "Data" → "EMG data"
  - Behavioral data from the experiment computer under:
    - "Feedback" → "Data" → "Behavioral data"
- Lastly, turn off the computers, turn off the lights and lock the door on your way out
  - If there is any mess try to clean the lab and make it orderly
