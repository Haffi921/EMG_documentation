# Overview of the Equipment

## Electronic equipment in the lab:

- **Two computers**

  - **The Acquisition computer**

    This computer runs AcqKnowledge and receives the EMG data from the BIOPAC equipment

  - **The Experiment computer**

    This computer runs the experiment and sends out Markers to the acquisition unit

- **EMG Acquisition unit**
- **Amplifier Input Module**
- **Digital Interface**
- **A Smart Amplifier for each muscle recording**
- **A three point lead for each muscle recording**

### The EMG Acquisition unit: MP160

Connected to:

- Electricity via a power cable
- The acquisition computer, via an ethernet cable connected to a Ethernet-to-USB
- Digital Interface, via a side-connection
- Amplifier Input Module, via the Digital Interface also through a side-connection

Function:

- Receive data from the Amplifier Input Module and Digital Interface
- Send data to the acquisition computer

> **Note:** The EMG Acquisition unit can be turned on and off. It is recommended to turn the unit off at the end of the day

### Smart Amplifiers (EMG100D) and corresponding leads

Connected to:

- Each other, via a pinch-clip connector
- Amplifier Input Module, via ethernet ports on the front of the Amplifier Input Module
- Electrodes placed on the participant, connected with the lead's clips

Function:

- Record voltage readings from electrodes
- Send data to the Amplifier Input Module

## Other equipment in the lab:

### For electrodes:

- **Electrodes, three for each muscle**
- **Two-sided Electrode tape**

  For attaching the electrodes to participant

- **Electrode gel (SignaGel)**

  A conductive gel placed in the skin-side hole of the electrode. Used to increase conductivity between the participants face and the electrode. It is important that this gel touches both bottom of the electrode skin-side hole and the participant's face

- **Syringes**

  Used to insert the Electrode gel into the electrode's skin-side hole

### For skin preparation:

- **Skin preparation gel (Nuprep)**

  Grained skin gel used to remove dead skin-cells and increase the conductivity of the skin

- **Alcohol pads**

  Used to disinfect the cleaned skin

- **Cotton pads**

  For applying the skin preparation gel and clean off any moisture left from the alcohol pads

- **Single-use gloves**

  Always use gloves while preparation of the skin, placing of the electrodes and removing of the electrodes

### For cleaning afterwards:

- **Cotton swab sticks**

  Used to clean the used electrode gel out of the electrode

- **Tissues**

  For hygienic purposes. Place trash on tissues in order to keep the lab clean, as it often has gel on it.

### For recording data:

- **BIOPAC AcqKnowledge License key**

  Plug into the acquisition computer to open AcqKnowledge. Keep it plugged while the recording takes place. At the end of the day, unplug it and keep it safe! There are no other license keys!
